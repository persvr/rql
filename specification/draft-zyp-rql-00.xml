    <abstract>
      <t>Resource Query Languages (RQL) defines a syntactically simple query language 
      for querying and retrieving resources. RQL is designed to be URI friendly, 
      particularly as a query component of a URI, and highly extensible. RQL is a superset
      of HTML's URL encoding of form values, and a superset of Feed Item Query Language (FIQL).
      RQL basically consists of a set of nestable named operators which each have a set of 
      arguments and operate on a collection of resources. An example of an RQL for finding
      resources with a category of "toy" and sorted by price in ascending order:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
category=toy&sort(+price)

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>RQL consists of a set of nestable named operators which each have a set of 
      arguments. RQL is designed to be applied to a collection of resources. Each top-level 
      operator defines a constraint or modification to the result of the query from the base 
      collection of resources. Nested operators provide constraint information for the operators within which they are embedded. 
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Operators">
    <t>
      An operator consists of an operator name followed by a list of comma-delimited arguments within paranthesis:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
name(args,...)
]]></artwork></figure>
      Each argument may be a value (a string of unreserved or URL-encoded characters), an array, or another operator. The name of the operator indicates the type of action the operator will perform on the collection, using the given arguments. This document defines the semantics of a set of operators, but the query language can be extended with additional operators.</t>
<t>      
      A simple RQL query with a single operator that indicates a search for any 
      resources with a property of "foo" that has value of 3 could be written:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
eq(foo,3)
]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Values">
      <t>
	Simple values are simply URL-encoded sequences of characters. Unreserved characters do not need to be encoded, other characters should be encoding using standard URL encoding. Simple values can be decoded to determine the intended string of characters. Values can also include arrays or typed values. These are described in the "Typed Values" and "Arrays" section below.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Arrays">
      
      <t>
      One of the allowable arguments for operators is an array. An array is paranthesis-enclosed comma-delimited set of items. Each item in the array can be a value or an operator. A query that finds all the resources where the category can be "toy" or "food" could be written with an array argument:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
in(category,(toy,food))
]]></artwork></figure>
      
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Nested Operators">
      <t>
      Operators may be nested. For example, a set of operators can be used as the arguments for the "or" operator. Another query that finds all the resources where the category can be "toy" or "food" could be written with nested "eq" operators within an "or" operator:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
or(eq(category,toy),eq(category,food))
]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Defined Operators">
      
      <t>
      RQL defines the following semantics for these operators:
     <section title="sort">
      <t>sort(&lt;+|->&lt;property) - Sorts the returned query result by the given property. The order of sort is specified by the prefix (+ for ascending, - for descending) to property.
      To sort by foo in ascending order:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
sort(+foo)
]]></artwork></figure>
      One can also do multiple property sorts. To sort by price in ascending order and rating in descending order:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
sort(+price,-rating)
]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>
     </section>
     <section title="select">
      <t>select(&lt;property>) - Returns a query result where each item is value of the property specified by the argument</t>
      <t>select(&lt;property>,&lt;property>,...) - Trims each object down to the set of properties defined in the arguments</t>
     </section>
     <section title="aggregate">
      <t>aggregate(&lt;property|operator>,...) - The aggregate function can be used for aggregation, it aggregates the result set, grouping by objects that are distinct for the provided properties, and then reduces the remaining other property values using the provided operator. To calculate the sum of sales for each department:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
aggregate(departmentId,sum(sales))
]]></artwork></figure>
</t>
     </section>

     </section>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Comparison Syntax">
      
      <t>
    RQL provides a semantically equivelant syntactic alternate to operator syntax with comparison syntax. A comparison operator may
    be written in the form:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
name=value
]]></artwork></figure>
As shorthand for:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
eq(name,value)
]]></artwork></figure>
RQL also supports provides sugar for the "and" operator with ampersand delimited operators. The following form:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
operator&operator
]]></artwork></figure>
As shorthand for:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
and(operator,operator)
]]></artwork></figure>
With these transformations, one can write queries of the form:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
foo=3&bar=text
]]></artwork></figure>
This makes the HTML's form url encoding of name value pairs a proper query within RQL.</t>
<t>
Ampersand delimited operators may be grouped by placing them within paranthesis. Top level queries themselves are considered to be implicitly a part of an "and" operator group, and therefore the top level ampersand delimited operators do not need to be enclosed with paranthesis, but "and" groups used within other operators do need to be enclosed in paranthesis.</t>
<t>
Pipe delimited operators may also be placed within paranthesis-enclosed groups as shorthand for the "or" operator. One can write a query:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
foo=3&(bar=text|bar=string)
]]></artwork></figure>
Also, Feed Item Query Language is a subset of RQL valid. RQL supports named comparisons as shorthand for operators as well. The following form is a named comparison:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
name=comparator=value
]]></artwork></figure>
Which is shorthand for:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
comparator(name,value)
]]></artwork></figure>
For example, to find resources with a "price" less than 10:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
price=lt=10
]]></artwork></figure>
</t>
</section>
<section title="Typed Values">
<t>
Basic values in RQL are simply a string of characters and it is up to the recipient of a query to determine how these characters should be interpreted and if they should be coerced to alternate data types understood by the language or database processing the query. However, RQL supports typed values to provide hints to the recipient of the intended data type of the value. The syntax of a typed value is:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
type:value
]]></artwork></figure>
RQL suggests the following types to be supported:
<list>
<t>string - Indicates the value string should not be coerced, it should remain a string.</t>
<t>number - Indicates the value string should be coerced to a number.</t>
<t>boolean - Indicates the value string should be coerced to a boolean. A value of "true" should indicate true and a value of "false" should indicate false.</t>
<t>epoch - Indicates the value string should be treated as the milliseconds since the epoch and coerced to a date.</t>
</list>
For example, to query for resources where foo explicitly equals the number 4:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[	
foo=number:4
]]></artwork></figure>

</t>
</section>
<section title="ABNF for RQL">
<t>
The following is the collected ABNF for RQL:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
        <![CDATA[
query = and

and = operator *( "&" operator )
operator = comparison / call-operator / group
call-operator = name "(" [ argument *( "," argument ) ] ")"
argument = call-operator / value
value = *nchar / typed-value / array
typed-value = 1*nchar ":" *nchar
array = "(" [ value *( "," value ) ] ")"
name = *nchar

comparison = name ( "=" [ name "=" ] ) value
group = "(" ( and / or ) ")"
or = operator *( "|" operator )

nchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / "*" / "+"
pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

]]></artwork></figure>

</t>
</section>
<section title="HTTP">
<t>
If RQL is used as for to define queries in HTTP URLs, there are several considerations. First, servers that allow publicly initiated requests should enforce proper security measures to protect against excessive resource consumption. Many operators may be understood
by the server, but not efficiently executable and servers can therefore reject such queries. Rejections may be indicated by a 403 Forbidden status code response, or if authentication may provide the authorization necessary to perform the query, a 401 Unauthorized status code can be sent.
</t>
<t>
If the query is not syntactically valid, (does not follow the RQL grammar), the server may return a status code of 400 Bad Request. If the query is syntactically valid, but the operator name is not known, the server may also return a status code of 400 Bad Request.
